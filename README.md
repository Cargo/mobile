=======

This is the most up-to-date source code of the Mobile design for [Cargo](http://cargocollective.com). This design has all files for both dark and light versions of the mobile design. To use the dark version of the mobile design, edit the `mobile/mobile.handlebars` file on line `24`. Replace this line with `<body class="dark">`.
